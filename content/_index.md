### About Me



I am a 5th-year Computer Science PhD student at [UC Santa Barbara](https://www.ucsb.edu/), advised by [Yu Feng](https://fredfeng.github.io/). I'm broadly interested in helping programmers build provably correct and efficient software, using techniques from [programming languages](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Programming_language_theory) and [formal methods](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Formal_methods). Prior to this, I got my undergraduate degree from [Vassar College](https://www.vassar.edu/computerscience), and my M.S. from [Yale University](https://engineering.yale.edu/academic-study/departments/computer-science).


Outside of academia, I like playing music, and am currently studying the [carillon](https://www.gcna.org/about-carillons) with [Wesley Arai](https://music.ucsb.edu/people/faculty/wesley-arai). I occasionally post my progress videos [here](https://www.youtube.com/@roly4301). Previously, I studied organ with [Gail Archer](http://www.gailarcher.com/artist.html). I'm also mildly weeb, enjoying [owarai](https://www.youtube.com/@sissonnelive/videos), [podcasts](https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLYpJvGKpl7tao5DG9RIaNpj9kyjv8irCV&si=j2ElqqSnmbupkc5Y), and [anime](/images/3x3.jpg).
